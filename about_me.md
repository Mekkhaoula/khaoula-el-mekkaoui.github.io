## About Me

I'm a PhD Candidate at [Probabilistic Machine Learning group](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/), [Aalto University](http://www.aalto.fi/en/), working with Samuel Kaski. I am mainly interested in distributed learning, Bayesian learning, federated learning, and the junction between said topics and others, computationally-wise and from other aspects.
