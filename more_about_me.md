##  Moi! Welcome to my webpage.

I earned my MSc in Computer Science and a BSc in Mathematics and CS from [University Mohamed V](http://www.um5.ac.ma/um5/).

I have a relatively dispersed research interests. I started my Data Science journey from Mobile Development, to Smart TV apps development, to Hybrid development and 3D Unity game development, then to _Machine learning_, implemeting from _neural networks_ to _SVMs_ and _RNNs_ in _C_, then to _Bayesian Learning_, and specifically it's application on IoT devces and massivaley by-nature distributed data, and how can we benefit from this mergure. 

Having to do a choice between the known (Being accepted in a Masters program in Paris-Saclay), and the unkown (being accepted in a PhD. program in Finland), I chose to be a more advanterous and I have been learnign a tremdous amount of things until now, so I don't think I will regret it.
